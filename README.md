Homework assignment; fitting a Generalized Linear Model to some x-y data and investigating goodness-of-fit and optimizing with AIC. I did some empirical simulations that were not required, in order to get a more honest impression of the test statistics we're using.

Normal_GLM is not mine, it contains some subroutines given to us.
